//difference between window,screen and document in jsWindow:
WINDOW:

Window is the main JavaScript object root, ie. the global object in a browser. 
Also It can be treated as the root of the document object model. We can access it as window.
The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. 
This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.

DOCUMENT: 

The Document object(DOM) is our html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. 
The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
That means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property.

SCREEN:

Screen is window property that holds information of browser user screen.
It refers to screen object associated with that window object.
Used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc
Similar to document screen can be accessed either by window.screen or screen object directly. 
Screen object doesnâ€™t have any methods as in window and document objects.
